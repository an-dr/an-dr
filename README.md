### Hello

I'm Andrei. An embedded software developer. Here I have a lot of repositories using C, C++, Python, and a bit others.

My hobby is robotics, so probably the most interesting thing here is my robot Zakhar - here are some links
- [Zakhar the Robot | Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/171888-zakhar-the-robot)
- [an-dr/zakhar: A robotics UX project](https://github.com/an-dr/zakhar)
- [Robot with the Conscious: Imitating animal behavior for reducing userâ€™s anxiety â€“ technical_](https://blog.agramakov.me/2020/05/29/robot-with-the-conscious/)

Also, you could find here libraries for embedded projects, PowerShell and python packages, and a lot of other stuff. I would be happy if you participate in any of my projects but mind the license

If you are interested to know more about me welcome to my page: [Personal page of Andrei Gramakov](https://www.agramakov.me/)
