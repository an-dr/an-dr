### Hello

I'm Andrei. An embedded software developer. Here I have a lot of repositories using C, C++, Python, and a bit others.

My hobby is robotics, I have several projects here on github and a hub with all my robotics projects. Check this out:

- [My Robotics Projects](https://agramakov.me/robots)
- [Zakhar the Robot | Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/171888-zakhar-the-robot) / [Zakhar the Robot - üê∂ an Alive Pet Companion üòª](https://github.com/Zakhar-the-Robot)
- [Alive OS - ROS-based OS](https://github.com/Alive-OS)
- [Robot with the Conscious: Imitating animal behavior for reducing user‚Äôs anxiety ‚Äì technical_](https://blog.agramakov.me/2020/05/29/robot-with-the-conscious/)

I'm interested not only in the software development but also in the software architecture. Check out my architecture framework:

- [Small Project Architecture (SPA)](https://github.com/an-dr/spa) - a framework that keeps the quality high and the project fun.

Also, you can find here libraries for embedded projects, PowerShell and Python packages, and a lot of other stuff. I would be happy if you participate in any of my projects but mind the license

If you are interested to know more about me welcome to my page: [Personal page of Andrei Gramakov](https://www.agramakov.me/) or you can [download my CV](cv/Andrei_Gramakov_CV.pdf).
